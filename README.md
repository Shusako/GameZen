## 📍 Overview

The GameZen plugin is a BetterDiscord plugin that aims to enhance the user experience by automatically activating Do Not Disturb mode and updating the user status when any game is launched. Its core value proposition lies in its ability to enhance productivity and immersion during gaming sessions by managing notifications effectively. You can also configure a list of games to ignore, ensuring that certain games do not trigger the Do Not Disturb mode.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✔️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have **BetterDiscord** installed. If not, you can download it from the official website: [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app).

### 📦 Installation

1. Download the GameZen plugin file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/GameZen).
2. In Discord, go to your BetterDiscord settings and select the Plugins tab.
3. At the top click the Open Plugins Folder button.
4. Drag and drop, or move, the plugin you downloaded into this folder.
5. Go back to your Plugins pages and enable your plugin.

### 🎮 Using GameZen

Once the plugin is installed and Discord is running, GameZen will automatically activate `Do Not Disturb` mode when a game is launched. When you close the game, it will restore your previous status.

### 📝 Ignore List

You can configure a list of games to ignore, ensuring that certain games do not trigger the Do Not Disturb mode. This can be done through the settings panel of the plugin.
